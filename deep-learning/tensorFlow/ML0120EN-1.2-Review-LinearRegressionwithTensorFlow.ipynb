In a simple linear regression there are two variables, the dependent variable, which can be seen as the \"state\" or \"final goal\" that we study and try to predict, and the independent variables, also known as explanatory variables, which can be seen as the \"causes\" of the \"states\". \n","\n","When more than one independent variable is present the process is called multiple linear regression. <br>\n","When multiple dependent variables are predicted the process is known as multivariate linear regression.\n","\n","The equation of a simple linear model is\n","\n","$$Y = a X + b $$\n","\n","Where Y is the dependent variable and X is the independent variable, and <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> being the parameters we adjust. <b>a</b> is known as \"slope\" or \"gradient\" and <b>b</b> is the \"intercept\".
