    "Portobello Tech is an app innovator that has devised an intelligent way of predicting employee turnover within the company. It periodically evaluates employees' work details including the number of projects they worked upon, average monthly working hours, time spent in the company, promotions in the last 5 years, and salary level.\n",
    "Data from prior evaluations show the employeeâ€™s satisfaction at the workplace. The data could be used to identify patterns in work style and their interest to continue to work in the company. \n",

    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tPerform data quality check by checking for missing values if any.\n",
    "2.\tUnderstand what factors contributed most to employee turnover by EDA.\n",
    "3.\tPerform clustering of Employees who left based on their satisfaction and evaluation.\n",
    "4.\tHandle the left Class Imbalance using SMOTE technique.\n",
    "5.\tPerform k-fold cross-validation model training and evaluate performance. \n",
    "6.\tIdentify the best model and justify the evaluation metrics used. \n",
